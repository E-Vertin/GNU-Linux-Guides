## Introduction

This project is a collection of installation guides, tips, and tricks for various GNU/Linux distributions. It is intended for users who are new to GNU/Linux. 

The guides are written by us, the contributors, and are based on our experiences with the distributions. We aim to provide clear and concise instructions that are easy to follow. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an **issue** or submit a **pull request**.

> [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) is an Arch-based distro that provides an Arch experience without the hassle of installing it manually for both x86_64 and ARM systems. After installation, you’re provided with a lightweight and almost bare-bones environment ready to be explored with your terminal, along with our home-built Welcome App as a powerful guide to help you along.

Because it is easier to install and closer to its upstream (Arch Linux), it is the top choice for users who want to get familiar with Arch Linux in the future.
